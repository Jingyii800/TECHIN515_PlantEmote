## PlantEmote
While plants cannot communicate emotions like humans or animals, they exhibit changes in physiological states that can indicate their health and well-being. Traditional methods of monitoring plant health can be invasive or require close observation. 

The PlantEmote project seeks to provide a novel, non-invasive approach to monitor and visualize the "mood" of plants, using biometric and electrical signals to interpret their health status, which is then creatively displayed through an AI-generated interpretation of the plantâ€™s "mood" on a web UI.
